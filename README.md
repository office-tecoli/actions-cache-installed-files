This GitHub action execute given script, and cache installed files for
later use.  When executed next time with same package list, and any
other environment are not changed, updated files are extracted from

different operating system environment.  If you need to use different
cache for other reason, provide a key by parameter.

Output is same as [`@actions/cache`](https://github.com/actions/cache).
